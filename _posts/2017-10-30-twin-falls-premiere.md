title: Twin Falls Premiere Nov 5th

The Hometown Premiere of App: The Human Story comes to the Orpheum Theatre, Sunday, Nov 5th, at 7 pm.

This feature length documentary gives a voice to the passionate community of indie app developers. App: The Human Story is a look at the coming of age of an all new art form.

With the launch of the iPhone and subsequent devices, developers found themselves with a worldwide market hungry for their innovations: apps.

Yet, a renaissance needs cultivation, not exploitation. Ten years in, is the opportunity gone? Will artists find a way to create tools that elevate the human experience, or will the market be valued even above the impact to the future of the industry?

The concept for the film was conceived in Twin Falls in 2012 while the original directors both resided there. For parents considering bringing their children, please be aware there is some infrequent swearing in the film.

Tickets are $10 and available at the door and online. Backers who purchased premiere tickets during the film's Kickstarter campaign are encouraged to RSVP via email to <a href="mailto:co@storyandpixel.com">co@storyandpixel.com</a>. They will enjoy VIP seating and complimentary drinks at the after party. 

The film's director, Jake Schumacher, will be in attendance and there will be a short Q&A after the film.
